                <b>Borova: The Forsaken Village</b> is my Final Degree Project, a first-person psychological horror and mystery game developed using Unreal Engine. The game focuses on exploration, environmental storytelling, and unraveling a dark narrative within an isolated and unsettling village. Players navigate the eerie landscapes of Borova, piecing together clues and facing psychological challenges to uncover the village's hidden secrets and the fate of its forsaken inhabitants.

            <p class="project-description">
                Developed entirely within <b>Unreal Engine</b>, Borova leverages the engine's robust tools for visual fidelity, atmospheric design, and interactive environments. The project integrates both <b>C++</b> for core gameplay systems and <b>Blueprints</b> for rapid prototyping and level design, allowing for a flexible and efficient development workflow.

                    <p>
                        I was responsible for designing and implementing the core gameplay mechanics that drive the player experience in Borova. This involved:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Player Movement and Interaction:</b> Implementing smooth first-person controls, object interaction systems, and puzzle mechanics using both C++ for foundational elements and Blueprints for specific in-world interactions.</li>
                        <li> <b>Narrative Delivery Systems:</b> Developing systems for delivering the game's narrative through environmental storytelling, interactable notes and documents, and potential dialogue sequences. This included managing the flow of information and ensuring it aligns with the player's progression.</li>
                        <li> <b>Inventory and Item Management:</b> Creating a functional inventory system that allows players to collect and utilize key items to solve puzzles and progress through the game.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A key focus was ensuring that the gameplay mechanics seamlessly integrated with the narrative, enhancing the sense of mystery and psychological tension.

                        I took a lead role in designing the layout of Borova and crafting its unsettling atmosphere. My contributions included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>World Building:</b> Creating the overall structure of the village, including key locations, pathways, and interconnected areas designed to evoke a sense of isolation and mystery.</li>
                        <li> <b>Environmental Storytelling:</b> Utilizing Unreal Engine's tools to populate the environment with details, props, and visual cues that subtly convey the village's history and the fate of its inhabitants.</li>
                        <li> <b>Lighting and Mood:</b> Implementing and adjusting lighting scenarios, fog effects, and visual elements to enhance the psychological horror aspects of the game and create a pervasive sense of dread.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The goal was to make the environment itself a key component of the narrative, encouraging players to explore and interpret the visual information presented.

                    <h3>Psychological Horror Elements & Puzzles</h3>
                    <span class="tags">

                        <span class="tag">Psychological Horror</span>
                    </span>
                    <p>
                        To achieve the desired psychological horror experience, I designed and implemented various elements, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Puzzle Integration:</b> Creating puzzles that are not only challenging but also thematically relevant to the game's narrative, often requiring players to piece together information gathered through exploration.</li>
                        <li> <b>Atmospheric Sound Design Implementation:</b> Working with sound assets and Unreal Engine's audio system to create a chilling soundscape that enhances tension and unease. (Note: Sound assets themselves might have been sourced or created by others, but implementation within the engine was a key contribution).</li>
                        <li> <b>Visual and Subtle Horror Techniques:</b> Utilizing visual cues, environmental changes, and subtle effects to create a sense of unease and psychological tension without relying solely on jump scares.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The focus was on creating a sustained atmosphere of dread and suspense, engaging the player's mind and making them question the reality of the game world.
