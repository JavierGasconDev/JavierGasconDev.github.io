                <b>MinaVR</b> is an immersive virtual reality experience developed in Unreal Engine, designed to simulate the challenging and rewarding work of mining. Players don a VR headset and become miners, tasked with extracting valuable resources from a dynamic and interactive environment. The game emphasizes realistic physics, precise tool handling, and strategic decision-making in a safe, yet engaging, virtual setting.

                        I designed and implemented the core VR interaction system, allowing players to naturally interact with the mining environment and tools. This involved developing realistic hand tracking and physics-based interactions for actions such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>   <b>Tool Handling:</b>  Picking up, wielding, and manipulating various mining tools (pickaxes, drills, etc.) with precise control.</li>
                        <li>   <b>Resource Extraction:</b>  Breaking rocks, collecting minerals, and managing resources within the VR space.</li>
                        <li>   <b>Environmental Interaction:</b>  Navigating the mine, operating machinery, and interacting with dynamic elements like levers and buttons.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The system was built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new tools and interaction types.

                    <p>
                        I developed a procedural generation system to create diverse and replayable mine environments. This system utilized Unreal Engine's Blueprints to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>   <b>Varying Cave Layouts:</b>  Generate unique cave networks with different sizes, shapes, and complexities.</li>
                        <li>   <b>Resource Distribution:</b>  Dynamically place mineral deposits, hazards, and points of interest throughout the mine.</li>
                        <li>   <b>Environmental Assets:</b>  Populate the environment with rocks, debris, and other details to enhance realism.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This ensured that each playthrough offered a fresh and challenging experience for the player.

                        Given the demanding nature of VR, I focused on optimizing the game to ensure smooth and comfortable performance. This involved:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>   <b>Reducing Draw Calls:</b>  Merging meshes and optimizing material complexity to minimize the number of draw calls.</li>
                        <li>   <b>Level Streaming:</b>  Implementing level streaming to dynamically load and unload sections of the mine, reducing memory usage.</li>
                        <li>   <b>VR Specific Optimizations:</b>  Utilizing VR-specific rendering techniques to maximize frame rate and minimize latency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These optimizations were crucial for delivering a high-quality VR experience without causing motion sickness or performance issues.
